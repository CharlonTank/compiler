# Contributing to the Lamdera compiler

Thanks contributing to the Lamdera compiler!

The Lamdera **compiler** is a free, open-source and open-contribution [un-fork of the Elm compiler](https://dashboard.lamdera.app/releases/open-source-compiler).

## Style Guide

We don't have a particular style enforcement tool in place, but generally
we prefer Elm-like layout that's indented with two spaces, with no trailing
whitespace.

## Branches

  * [The lamdera-next branch][lamdera-next] is the home of the next release of the compiler
    so new features and improvements get merged there. Most pull requests
    should target this branch, it is the repo default branch.

##Â Development guide

Check out the [extra/readme.md](extra/readme.md) for more information on how to get started with development.

If you're planning on embarking on a feature, come chat with us on the [Lamdera Discord](https://dashboard.lamdera.app/docs/discuss) as it's possible we're already working on it, or have some thoughts that will be helpful to get the best result and ensure it can be merged quickly.
