## Lamdera

The `/extra` folder contains all the Lamdera extension code integrated into the Elm compiler.

The integration philosophy is:

- Inject as small a surface area into actual compiler code as feasibly possible
  - You'll see this done with certain tricks using `&` and `$` to, wherever possible, only add additional lines to source, without modifying any existing lines
  - This means merge conflicts are minimized when trying to stay up to date with upstream Elm Compiler

- Otherwise use Elm compiler source liberally inside `/extra`
  - We don't want to reinvent the wheel on core compiler concepts, and can lean heavily on Haskell's type system to tell us when there are problems due to core type changes upstream

The idea is that searching the project for `import Lamdera` will reveal every single `/builder` and `/compiler` core file that has some Lamdera related modification.


### Lamdera.hs

This File acts as our custom Prelude. There is some duplication of core compiler functions to avoid cyclic import issues.


### `Sanity` (or, how to deal with `Map.!: given key is not an element in the map`)

Sometimes the compiler code will throw an error like this:

```
<interactive>: Map.!: given key is not an element in the map
CallStack (from HasCallStack):
  error, called at libraries/containers/containers/src/Data/Map/Internal.hs:627:17 in containers-0.6.2.1:Data.Map.Internal
```

This is pretty unhelpful as we have no idea where in the source code the (!) failed or with what values (Yep, Map.! is unsafe and throws exceptions ðŸŽ‰)

Run the `./addSanity.sh` script if this happens and retry. You should now get this:

```
<interactive>: Sanity failed!
CallStack (from HasCallStack):
  error, called at /Users/mario/dev/projects/elmx/extra/Sanity.hs:13:9 in main:Sanity
  !, called at /Users/mario/dev/projects/elmx/compiler/src/Type/Solve.hs:100:42 in main:Type.Solve
```

Now we have the actual usage point where it failed. If we want to debug it, `Sanity.debug` helps:

```
do  actual <- makeCopy rank pools (env ! name)

-- Adjust to
do  actual <- makeCopy rank pools (env `debugFind` name)
```

Which will now print out the keys and the missing key, if you have `Show` instances for them.

See `Sanity.hs` for other helpers.

Run `./removeSanity.sh` to revert the debugging changes!


### live.js

Used by `lamdera live`, this file needs to be packaged with parcel into `/extra/dist/live.js` and then inlined by the compiler.

To package:

```
cd extra
npm i
parcel build live.js --no-source-maps
```
